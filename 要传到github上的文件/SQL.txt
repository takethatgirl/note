SELECT 列 FROM 表
SELECT LastName FROM Persons
SELECT LastName,FirstName FROM Persons
SELECT * FROM Person
SELECT DISTINCT Conpany FROM Orders //列重复元素只保留一个

WHERE的操作符：
 =  !=  >  <  <=  >=  BETWEEN 某个范围内 LIKE 搜索某种模式
SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE City = 'BeiJing'
SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE Age <= 30

AND OR 用于WHERE语句
SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE FirstName = 'Lee' AND LastName = 'Ryan'
SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE FirstName = 'Lee' OR Age > 30
AND OR结合( )威力更大
SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE (FirstName = 'Lee' AND LastName = 'Ryan') OR Age > 30

SELECT Company, OrderNumber FROM Orders ORDER BY Company //以Company列升序排列
SELECT Company, OrderNumber FROM Orders ORDER BY Company, OrderNumber//以Company列升序排列，相同的Company列再以OrderNumber升序排列
SELECT Company, OrderNumber FROM Orders ORDER BY Company DESC //降序排列 z y x w v u ...
SELECT Company, OrderNumber FROM Orders ORDER BY Company DESC, OrderNumber ASC //ASC是升序

INSERT INTO 向表中插入新的行
INSERT INTO 表名称 VALUES(值1，值2...)
INSERT INTO 表名称 (列1，列2 ...)(值1，值2，...)

Update 修改表中的数据
UPDATE Persons SET FirstName = 'Fred' WHERE LastName = 'Wilson' 
UPDATE Persons SET Address = 'Zhongshan 23', City = 'Nanjing'
WHERE LastName = 'Wilson'

删除行
DELETE FROM Person WHERE LastName = 'Wilson'
